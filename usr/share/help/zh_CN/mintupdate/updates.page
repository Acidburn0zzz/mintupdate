    <title>The different types of updates</title>

    <p>有不同类型的更新：</p>

    <list>
      <item><p>“软件更新”是修复功能错误的更新(或者是带来新特性)。</p></item>
      <item><p>“安全更新”是修补安全漏洞的更新。</p></item>
      <item><p>“内核更新”表示安装新的内核。</p></item>
    </list>

    <p>Security is very important but also very technical. Vulnerabilities don't always affect your computer and can be quite difficult to understand. Most people don't understand them at all and their personal computers are rarely at risk. That said, a security breach can have dire consequences, so it is always recommended to take them seriously.</p>

    <p>By default, security updates are always visible, no matter what policy you chose and what level they are.</p>

    <p>Software updates aren't as important. They bring bug fixes or improvements which are not related to security. As such they're less urgent and can even be considered optional.</p>

    <note><p>在Linux Mint中，内核更新可以同时提供安全补丁和错误修复（有时也会包含一些新特性），而且这会影响到系统的关键部分。因此，从安全的角度来看，内核更新至关重要，但它同时也容易引发新用户难以修复的功能回退问题。</p></note>
