    <title>The different types of updates</title>

    <p>የ ተለያዩ የ ማሻሻያ አይነቶች አሉ</p>

    <list>
      <item><p>የ 'ሶፍትዌር ማሻሻያ' ችግሮች የሚጠግኑ ማሻሻያ ናቸው (ወይንም አንዳድ ጊዜ አዲስ ገጽታዎችን ያመጣሉ).</p></item>
      <item><p>የ 'ደህንነት ማሻሻያ' ያልተረጋጉ ችግሮችን ማሻሻያ ናቸው</p></item>
      <item><p>የ 'ከረኔል ማሻሻያ' የሚጠቅመው አዲስ ከረኔል ለ መግጠም ነው</p></item>

    <p>Security is very important but also very technical. Vulnerabilities don't always affect your computer and can be quite difficult to understand. Most people don't understand them at all and their personal computers are rarely at risk. That said, a security breach can have dire consequences, so it is always recommended to take them seriously.</p>

    <p>By default, security updates are always visible, no matter what policy you chose and what level they are.</p>

    <p>Software updates aren't as important. They bring bug fixes or improvements which are not related to security. As such they're less urgent and can even be considered optional.</p>

    <note><p>In Linux Mint, kernel updates bring both security patches and bug fixes (and sometimes even new features), and they impact critical parts of the operating system. This makes kernel updates important from a security point of view, but also prone to regressions which can be hard to fix for novice users.</p></note>
